In addition to software authored by ARIN, there exists two non-ARIN authored packages which utilize ARIN services:

* **ARINWhois.NET** is a .NET client library for Whois-RWs written by Max Hortsmann. More information can be found on [it's GitHub project page](https://github.com/MaxHorstmann/ArinWhois.NET).
* **Whois Stats** is a Javascript conversion utility written by Robert Jensen which will take ARIN statistics files, sometimes called "extended stats", and convert them to JSON. This software can be found [it's GitHub project page](https://github.com/r1b/whois-stats).
