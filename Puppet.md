# Puppet

Puppet, an automated administrative engine for your Linux, Unix, and Windows systems, performs administrative tasks (such as adding users, installing packages, and updating server configurations) based on a centralized specification.

ARIN makes extensive use of Puppet to manage its systems, and makes available most modifications to Puppet modules that ARIN has modified and makes available many Puppet modules ARIN has authored.
